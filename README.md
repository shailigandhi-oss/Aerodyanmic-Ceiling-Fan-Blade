# Aerodyanmic-Ceiling-Fan-Blade
This project develops a tapered ceiling fan blade using scaled NACA 4412 airfoil sections from hub to tip. By combining gradual size reduction with varying incidence angles, the design optimizes airflow, reduces drag, improves energy efficiency, and maintains consistent aerodynamic performance across the span.
